### PR-ideas

#### Going outside the IT-geeks community

Ethereum dev team is probably the most skilled team the crypto world has ever seen. Vitalik and others visited thematic conferences, experienced standing ovations there etc. I don't think we need any PR in cryptocommunity - maybe in IT-community, but not in this subset. But that's not what I want to focus on here; there's still some thing our developers didn't think about a lot (am I mistaken?). I'm talking about PR **outside** of IT-geek community.

The game is not only about coding. Community is even more important for scalability.

Ethereum is the only thing that can beat Bitcoin. We *must* use this chance.

Basically, there are two types of PR: in your local region (based on the knowledge of popular in your region websites) and global PR (in English language). I have a proposal. Suppose these two types do not coincide in your case (you were not born in Manhattan). So you're Japanese developer, one of 80(?) other contributors. My proposal is the following.

You should decide whether are you good publicist or not. Are you orator? I understand that not everybody can be good publicist (almost nobody actually); for example, Japanese developer may be extremely shy nerd and not able to do PR job in Japanese society. But we are startup, and if (only if) a person has the ability to spread the word, he should. Chinese contributors should guide Ethereum official account in Weibo, British - in Tumblr, Russian - in Vkontakte.. We should do it ourselves and by our friends.

I registered them (they are empty though). But there's still something to do. We should also register accounts at Weibo, Flickr, Tumblr <what other popular "blogging" platforms are there all over the world?>. We have Arabic and Japanese developers, they . 

Something about global PR


 There are a lot of worth thinking about regions - Argentina&Brazil, Japan, South Korea, North Europe, Dubai..

#### PR amongst IT-related busy people

We should make a bunch of posters. We should make it easy-going and funny, else it wouldn't catch anybody's eye! Explain things easy that way. Short (IT-related busy people)-friendly version of Ethereum White Paper as poster/presentation.

#### Viral marketing

We definitely have to make something viral. It's probably good idea to make it chaotic and idiotic, strange, enigmatic, cryptic; our viral ad must be remarkable - and of course it shouldn't be dull! It should be poetry like

MACARENUM MACARENUM
MESSI LEO ETHEREUM
OFIGEUM OHRENEUM

Limericks, hokku..

For not getting used to them, ads should change; it would be better if these changes would interweave into a story.  

It should be video ("The xx - Decentralized").

### Minor ideas


4) [ONLY AFTER THE LAUNCH] Faucets but not as it is now in cryptoworld. Instead we should chaotically donate remarkable 'not very IT' bloggers, donate in ETH and with significant sums equivalent to ~0.5 BTC.  Probably donate to remarkable (art-)bloggers in ETH. We should donate something we like, and it should cover as much spheres as possible.

5) I see three reasons for that.

* In order to prevent the situation when two of us do the same job. You see sometimes I get interested in subjects you didn't ask me to think about. I guess I'm not the only one with this attribute.  We should know better on what who's working.

* salaries&bounties should completely transparent, you should create something like Google Spreadsheet, so that other participants could freely leave comments "gavoyfork is one of the best coders, I'd even suggest he should have been paid not 5 BTC for what he did last month, but even 7 BTC"
A sheet per person, everybody can edit his page, everybody can 

look/comment all the pages.


Everything should be transparent.

* It is useful to formulate the results of your work even if no one is going to control you. It clears the mind.

6) To oblige documentation translators to explain every intention in their words or issue back that they don't understand what does "these and these thoughts" stand for. They *must* understand every single idea. It would also improve English documentation, would make it more user-friendly.

7) We should do something against cybersquatters - in Twister (P2P analogue of Twitter) accounts @microsoft, @google, @dropbox, @linux, @gnu, @apple were registered immediately.
